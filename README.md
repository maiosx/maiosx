I'm Daniel. I'm a UX Designer and a Media Mogul, Entertainment is the Misery Business after all.

My hobbies include listening to music, watching movies, and helping others organize their lives.

I also used to make custom designs for [Valve](https://valvesoftware.com) and [Opera](https://opera.com).

I am not officially affiliated with Apple Inc. in any way even though the maiOSX domain is macosx.blog that was just a lucky grab.
