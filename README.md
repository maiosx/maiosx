I'm Daniel. I'm a UX Designer and a media connoisseur, Entertainment is the misery business after all.
I'm an independent developer designing maiOSX, my beloved file manager for the web.
- ⚡ Fun fact: maiOSX includes a turbo mode for low-end hardware!
  
My hobbies include listening to all kinds of music, watching movies, and helping others organize their lives.

I also used to make custom designs for [Valve](https://valvesoftware.com) and [Opera](https://opera.com).

I am not officially affiliated with [Apple Inc.](https://apple.com) in any way- the maiOSX domain is [macosx.blog](https://macosx.blog), that was just a lucky grab.
