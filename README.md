## Hello, World! ‚ù§Ô∏è
<p>Welcome to the home of maiOSX, the tumblr "OS" made to run on virtually anything!</p>

maiOSX Snow Leopard is a third generation OS for the web, succeeding ReaperOS and waveOS. It uses the latest greatest web standards.

- ‚ö° Fun fact: maiOSX includes a turbo mode for low-end hardware!
- Hint: Password Protection only works for secondary blogs on Tumblr!

Wave Inc. is not affiliated with [Apple Inc.](https://apple.com) in any way- the maiOSX domain is [macosx.blog](https://macosx.blog), but that was just a lucky grab.
